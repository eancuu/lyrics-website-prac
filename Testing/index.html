            <h4>LYRICS</h4>
            <pre>
How could my day be bad
When I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Lately, life's so boring
I've been watching Netflix all day long
I thought there would be
No things left to watch
So I let myself out
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we just smiled
We already know that we'll be together (we'll be together)
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
Coffee in the morning, you and the sun
There's a brown hue in your eyes
How pretty it is
I think I'm in love
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we smiled
And I finally held your hands
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who gives me love
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Oh, babe
